# 🌍 Strategic Forecasting of International Tourist Visits to Indonesia (C++)

This is a console-based application built using **C++** that performs **multiple linear regression** to predict the total number of international tourists visiting Indonesia. It uses entry points (air, land, and sea) as predictors and calculates **regression coefficients** as well as **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)** for accuracy evaluation.

## 📊 Features
- Input custom monthly data for:
  - X1: Air Entry Tourists
  - X2: Land Entry Tourists
  - X3: Sea Entry Tourists
  - Y: Total Tourists
- Calculates:
  - Regression coefficients (B1, B2, B3)
  - Intercept (A)
  - Regression Equation: `Y = A + B1*X1 + B2*X2 + B3*X3`
  - Prediction for future data
  - MAPE for error evaluation

## 📌 Concepts Used
- **Multiple Linear Regression**
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
- **Statistical Calculations**
- **C++ vector, I/O, math, and formatting**
